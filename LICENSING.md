# Systemless Licensing

Copyright © 2026 Ben Letchford and Systemless contributors.

## Open-source distribution

The Systemless emulator and runtime code in this public repository is
distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for the full licence
text.

Bundled URW Core 35, Noto Sans Symbols 2 and Coppet fonts are distributed under the
SIL Open Font License 1.1. See their [URW source record](src/quickdraw/fonts/urw/README.md)
and [Noto source record](src/quickdraw/fonts/noto/README.md), including the original
copyright and licence notices.

[Coppet](src/quickdraw/fonts/coppet/README.md) is a modified Inter font fitted
using historical OFL Kurrajong data. Its font binary, editable source and font
build script remain under [OFL-1.1](src/quickdraw/fonts/coppet/OFL.txt), with the
Inter and Kurrajong notices retained. They are not relicensed under the GPL;
the emulator integration is GPL-3.0-or-later. Coppet contains no Apple font
software or glyph artwork.

The Geneva 9 ASCII compatibility advances are a separate data component under
the SIL Open Font License 1.1. See its [source record](src/quickdraw/fonts/compatibility/README.md)
and [licence notice](src/quickdraw/fonts/compatibility/OFL.txt). The GPL runtime
embeds these separately licensed values while Coppet supplies the 9-point
ASCII artwork and URW supplies the remaining fallback glyphs.

The Chicago 12 ASCII advances, bearings and frame are further values from the
same OFL source; see the same source record.

Chicago Kare by Duane King, which supplies the glyph pixels for Chicago requests
at 12 points, is distributed under the MIT License. See its
[source record](src/quickdraw/fonts/chicago-kare/README.md) and
[licence](src/quickdraw/fonts/chicago-kare/LICENSE).

The Geneva 9 FontStruction by Kelsey Higham, which supplies the glyph pixels for
Application and Geneva requests at 9 points, is distributed under the Creative
Commons Attribution 3.0 licence. See its
[source record](src/quickdraw/fonts/fontstruct/README.md) and
[licence notice](src/quickdraw/fonts/fontstruct/license.txt).

## Separate commercial licensing

Ben Letchford may make software for which he holds sufficient rights available
under separate commercial licence terms. Receiving Systemless source from
GitHub or crates.io under the GPL does not grant a proprietary or separate
commercial licence.

A separately licensed Systemless distribution does not revoke or diminish any
GPL rights already granted in the open-source project. This document does not
change the licence of this GPL repository or offer a commercial licence to the
public.

## Contributions

Contributions are accepted subject to the current
[Systemless Contributor Agreement](./CLA.md). Contributors retain copyright in
their contributions and grant Ben Letchford the additional non-exclusive rights
described in that agreement.

Adding the agreement to this repository does not make historical contributors
subject to it. Existing contributors must accept it separately before their
work can be treated as covered by those additional permissions.

## Third-party components

Dependencies, third-party code, and assets remain governed by their respective
licences. A separately licensed Systemless distribution does not relicense
third-party material; every included component must independently permit that
distribution.

## Game and software content

Systemless does not obtain redistribution rights to classic Macintosh
applications or games merely because it can run them. Rights to distribute game
and application content are separate from the licensing of Systemless itself.
